The ! + Tab shortcut for generating an HTML boilerplate 
is a feature of the Emmet toolkit, which is built into 
Visual Studio Code for certain file types.

If it doesn't work in .blade.php files, it's because Emmet is enabled by default
only for standard HTML files (like .html). For Blade files, VS Code may not recognize them as HTML by default.

To enable Emmet in Blade files:

1.Open your VS Code settings (Ctrl+,).
2.Search for emmet.includeLanguages.
3. Add the following setting:

// Add this to your settings.json"emmet.includeLanguages": {    "blade": "html"}
This tells VS Code to treat Blade files as HTML for Emmet, enabling shortcuts like ! + Tab.

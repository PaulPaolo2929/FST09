LARAVEL NOTES - STEP 2 (FOLDER STRUCTURE)
-----------------------------------------

🏗️ THE BIG PICTURE:
Laravel is divided into parts — each folder has a job.
Think of it like a company:

- app/ → the workers (logic, controllers, models)
- resources/views/ → the designers (HTML, Blade templates)
- routes/web.php → the receptionist (decides which page to open)
- database/migrations/ → the builders (make tables)
- .env → the manager (controls settings)

-----------------------------------------

📁 IMPORTANT FOLDERS AND FILES (Simplified)

1. app/
   → Main code of your app (Models, Controllers, Middleware, etc.)
   → Example: app/Http/Controllers/PageController.php

2. bootstrap/
   → Starts Laravel when you run it
   → You rarely touch this

3. config/
   → Configuration settings (app name, timezone, mail, etc.)
   → Example: config/app.php

4. database/
   → Database files: migrations, seeders, and factories
   → Used to create or test tables

5. public/
   → Folder the browser can access
   → Contains index.php, CSS, JS, and images

6. resources/
   → Views (HTML files), CSS, JS, and language files
   → Example: resources/views/welcome.blade.php

7. routes/
   → Where all your routes are defined
   → Example: routes/web.php (defines your web pages)

8. storage/
   → Stores logs, cache, and uploaded files

9. tests/
   → Used for automated testing (for advanced users)

10. vendor/
    → Contains installed packages (created by Composer)
    → Do not edit this manually

11. .env
    → Environment file — holds database name, username, password, etc.

12. composer.json
    → Lists Laravel dependencies (packages)
    → Used by Composer to manage what your app needs


-----Detailed Explanation of Key Folders-----

1. app/
What it is:
This is where the main logic of your Laravel app lives.
It contains Controllers, Models, and other classes that handle how your app works behind the scenes.

Inside you’ll often see:
    - Http/Controllers/ → where you create controllers (the “brains” of your app)
    - Models/ → where you define models (the link to database tables)
    - Http/Middleware/ → used for security checks like “is the user logged in?”

Example:
app/Http/Controllers/PageController.php

🧠 Think of this as your app’s main engine.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. bootstrap/
What it is:
This folder is where Laravel gets everything ready when your app starts.
It’s like the “starter” that boots up Laravel.

You usually don’t touch this folder.

🧠 Think of it like the ignition switch of a car — it starts Laravel up.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. config/
What it is:
This folder contains all the configuration settings for your app — things like timezone, app name, mail settings, etc.

Example files:
    - config/app.php → main app settings (name, timezone)
    - config/database.php → database settings
    - config/mail.php → email settings

🧠 Think of this like the control panel where you adjust system settings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. database/
What it is:
This folder holds everything related to your database.
It contains migrations (to create tables), seeders (to add test data), and factories (to generate fake data).

Example files:
    - migrations/ → files that define your database tables
    - seeders/ → files to add sample data to your tables
    - factories/ → files to create fake data for testing
🧠 Think of this as your database workshop where tables are built and tested.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. public/
What it is:
This is the only folder that the web server can access directly.
When someone visits your site, Laravel loads the files here.

It contains:
    - index.php → the main entry point for all requests
    - CSS, JS, images → static files for your website

🧠 Think of this as the front door of your website that visitors see.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. resources/
What it is:
This folder contains your views (HTML files), CSS, JS, and language files.
It’s where you design what your website looks like.
Example files:
    - views/ → Blade templates (HTML with special Laravel syntax)
    - css/ → your custom CSS files
    - js/ → your custom JavaScript files
    - lang/ → language files for localization
🧠 Think of this as your design studio where the look and feel of your site is created.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. routes/
What it is:
This folder contains all the route definitions for your application.
Routes tell Laravel which controller to use when a user visits a specific URL.
Example files:
    - web.php → routes for web pages
    - api.php → routes for API endpoints
    - console.php → routes for command-line tasks
    - channels.php → routes for broadcasting channels

🧠 Think of this as the map/receptionist who directs visitors to the right place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. storage/
What it is:
This folder is used to store logs, cache files, and user-uploaded files.
It has several subfolders:
    - app/ → for user-uploaded files
    - framework/ → for cache and session files
    - logs/ → for application log files
🧠 Think of this as your app’s warehouse of storageroom where important files are stored.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------   
9. tests/
What it is:
This folder is used for automated testing of your application.
It contains test cases to ensure your app works as expected.
Example files:
    - Feature/ → tests that check larger parts of your app
    - Unit/ → tests that check individual pieces of code

🧠 Think of this as your quality control department ensuring everything works correctly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. vendor/
What it is:
This folder contains all the third-party packages that your Laravel app depends on
laravel Itself leves here.

You should nevr manually edit this files
🧠 Think of this as the library of all tools Laravel needs to function.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. .env
What it is:
This is the environment file that holds sensitive information like your database name, username, password, and
other settings specific to your environment (development, production, etc.)
You can change settings here without touching the code.
🧠 Think of this as your app’s manager who controls important settings.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. composer.json
What it is:
This file lists all the dependencies (packages) your Laravel app needs.
It’s used by Composer to install and manage these packages.
You can add new packages here when you want to extend your app’s functionality.
🧠 Think of this as your app’s shopping list for tools and libraries it needs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------
🚀 SUMMARY:
Laravel’s folder structure is designed to keep things organized.
Each folder has a specific role, making it easier to find and manage different parts of your application
as it grows.
Understanding this structure is key to becoming proficient in Laravel development.

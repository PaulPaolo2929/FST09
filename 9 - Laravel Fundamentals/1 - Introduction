LARAVEL CORE FEATURES
--------------------

1. **Routing**  
   ➤ Defines the website pages or URLs.  
   ➤ Example: `/home`, `/about`, `/contact`  

2. **Controllers**  
   ➤ Acts as the "brain" of your app.  
   ➤ Handles logic — fetch data, process it, and show the right view.  

3. **Views (Blade)**  
   ➤ Displays the HTML part of your website.  
   ➤ Example: The visual layout that users see.  

4. **Models**  
   ➤ Connects to the database.  
   ➤ Used to interact with tables (e.g., get, add, or update data).  

5. **Migrations**  
   ➤ Used to create or modify database tables easily.  
   ➤ Command: `php artisan migrate`  

6. **Authentication**  
   ➤ Handles login and registration systems.  
   ➤ Example: Users, passwords, roles.  

7. **Eloquent ORM**  
   ➤ A simple way to write database queries using PHP instead of SQL.  
   ➤ Example: `User::all()` gets all users without writing SQL manually.

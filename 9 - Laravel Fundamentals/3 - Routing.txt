📘 **STEP 3: ROUTING (Laravel Notes)**

🧠 What is Routing?
Routing defines how your Laravel app responds to different URLs (like `/home`, `/about`, etc.).
All routes are stored in `routes/web.php`.

---

✅ Basic Example:

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
```

➡️ When you visit `/`, Laravel shows `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`.

---

📄 Example for Another Page:

```php
Route::get('/about', function () {
    return view('about');
});
```

➡️ When you visit `/about`, it shows `resources/views/about.blade.php`.

---

🎯 Route Methods:

| Method | Description | Example |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| GET | Display a page or data | `Route::get('/home', ...)` |
| POST | Send form data | `Route::post('/submit', ...)` |
| PUT | Update existing data | `Route::put('/update', ...)` |
| DELETE | Delete data | `Route::delete('/remove', ...)` |

---

🧩 Routing with Controllers:

```php
Route::get('/students', [StudentController::class, 'index']);
```

➡️ When someone visits `/students`, Laravel runs the `index()` function in `StudentController`.

---

📦 Passing Data to a View:

```php
Route::get('/hello', function () {
    return view('greeting', ['name' => 'Paul']);
});
```

Then in `resources/views/greeting.blade.php`:

```blade
<h1>Hello, {{ $name }}!</h1>
```

Result → Hello, Paul!

---

📁 View Folder:
All your views go inside `resources/views/`.

Examples:
- `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`
- `resources/views/about.blade.php`

---

🧾 List All Routes:

```bash
php artisan route:list
```

---

✅ **Summary:**
- Routes live in `routes/web.php`
- Connect URLs → pages or controllers
- Use `Route::get()`, `Route::post()`, etc.
- To check all routes → `php artisan route:list`

LARAVEL COMPLETE NOTES — STEP 7: MODELS & ELOQUENT ORM
======================================================

🧠 WHAT IS A MODEL?
-------------------
A **Model** is a PHP class that represents a database table.

If you have a `students` table → you’ll create a `Student` model.

This model lets you interact with the table easily using code instead of SQL.

✅ Example:
   Instead of writing SQL like:
      SELECT * FROM students;
   You can simply write:
      Student::all();

That’s what we call **Eloquent ORM**.

💡 WHAT IS ELOQUENT ORM?
------------------------
**Eloquent** is Laravel’s built-in ORM (Object Relational Mapper).
It lets you talk to your database using **simple PHP syntax**.

You don’t need to type SQL queries — Eloquent handles it.

📘 Example:
   Student::all(); → Get all students
   Student::find(1); → Get student with ID 1
   Student::create([...]); → Insert new student
   $student->update([...]); → Update student
   $student->delete(); → Delete student

---

🏗️ STEP 1 — CREATE A MODEL
---------------------------
Run this command:
   php artisan make:model Student

✅ This creates:
   app/Models/Student.php

Open that file — it should look like this:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Student extends Model
{
    use HasFactory;

    protected $fillable = ['name', 'email'];
}
